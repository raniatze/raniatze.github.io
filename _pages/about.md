I am a PhD student in the Autonomous Vision Group (AVG) at University of TÃ¼bingen, advised by Prof. Andreas Geiger. Prior to this, I was an undergraduate in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering in the National Technical University of Athens in Greece, where I worked with Prof. Petros Maragos and Dr. Anastasios Roussos.
