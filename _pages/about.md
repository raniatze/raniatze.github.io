I am a PhD student in the [Autonomous Vision Group (AVG)](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/autonomous-vision/home/) at University of TÃ¼bingen, advised by [Prof. Andreas Geiger](https://www.cvlibs.net/). Prior to this, I was an undergraduate in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering in the National Technical University of Athens in Greece, where I worked with [Prof. Petros Maragos](http://cvsp.cs.ntua.gr/maragos/) and [Dr. Anastasios Roussos](https://users.ics.forth.gr/~troussos/).
