I am a PhD student in the [Autonomous Vision Group (AVG)](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/autonomous-vision/home/) at University of TÃ¼bingen, advised by [Prof. Andreas Geiger](https://www.cvlibs.net/). 

My research interests lie at the intersection of Computer Vision, Computer Graphics and Machine Learning. In particular, I am interested in developing novel deep learning-based algorithms for efficient capturing and photo-realistic rendering of 3D real-world scenes. My long-term objective is to develop AI systems that can have human-like perception of 3D scenes, objects, and people while also understanding human-scene interactions. 

In October 2022, I completed my combined bachelor's and master's degree (Integrated Master) from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering [(ECE)](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en) at the National Technical University of Athens in Greece. As a master's student, I worked with [Prof. Petros Maragos](http://cvsp.cs.ntua.gr/maragos/) and [Dr. Anastasios Roussos](https://users.ics.forth.gr/~troussos/) on video anonymization, human motion retargeting, and photo-realistic human video generation with applications to sign languages.
